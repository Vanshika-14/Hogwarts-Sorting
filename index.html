<p><font color="white" face="Bernard MT" size="+2">One thousand years ago this story starts<br>
There were four sorcerers with strong and kind hearts<br>
Bold Gryffindor from wild moor<br>
Fair Ravenclaw from glen<br>
Sweet Hufflepuff from valley broad<br>
Shrewd Slytherin from fen<br>
They had a dream to teach all that they knew<br>
Witches and wizards came far and it grew<br>
'Til a castle stood tall by the shores of a lake<br>
And a thousand years later the magic remains<br>
Old Hogwarts Sorting Hat sing me a song<br>
Speak in my head tell me where I belong<br>
And when things look bad and there's no where to run<br>
Unite all the houses and we'll fight as one<br>
Brave Godric Gryffindor favoured the strong<br>
Those who had courage and knew right from wrong<br>
And Rowena Ravenclaw taught only the best<br>
So kind Helga Hufflepuff would teach all the rest<br>
But Salazar Slytherin had is own plans<br>
He thought the Muggle-borns didn't understand<br>
The subtleties of magic and so he devised<br>
The Chamber of Secrets with a monster inside<br>
Old Hogwarts Sorting Hat sing me a song<br>
Speak in my head tell me where I belong<br>
And when things look bad and there's no where to run<br>
Unite all the houses and we'll fight as one<br>
Old Hogwarts Sorting Hat sing me a song<br>
Speak in my head tell me where I belong<br>
And when things look bad and there's no where to run<br>
Unite all the houses and we'll fight as one<br>
